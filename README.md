**darkf.js** is a personal standard library for JavaScript. In other words, a compilation of functions I've constantly (re-)written over the years and finally decided to put into one place.

It is an opinionated library and not intended for widespread use. A lot of it just implements nice abstractions over containers or functions, which you might find in underscore/lodash/what-have-you. The difference is I aim to fill in some of the gaps that those libraries don't (like mapping over objects, for example.)
